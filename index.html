      <h1>The Invisible Layers</h1>
      <h2>From Ozone Recovery to Carbon Emissions</h2>
      <p>
        This project contrasts two atmospheric narratives: how global cooperation through the Montreal Protocol (1987) has helped the ozone layer recover, and how unregulated data center and AI infrastructure are driving new carbon emissions. Read together, they show how policy can either repair the atmosphere or lock in future climate risk.

    <h2>The Montreal Protocol: A Timeline of Global Action</h2>
    <p>
      The Montreal Protocol, signed in 1987, is often described as one of humanity’s most successful environmental treaties. It followed decades of scientific warnings about chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), chemicals used in refrigeration and aerosols that were found to destroy the ozone layer. Through coordinated global action, nations agreed to phase out these substances, and satellite data now shows a gradual healing of the ozone layer — clear evidence that science, regulation, and collective action can reverse planetary damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Protocol has continued to evolve as science and technology have advanced. Amendments such as those adopted in London and Kigali expanded its scope to include additional substances like hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). This living framework shows how international regulation can translate data into environmental recovery — a precedent for today’s challenge of governing carbon emissions from energy‑intensive digital infrastructure.

    <h2>Ozone Recovery After the Montreal Protocol</h2>
    <p>
      The Montreal Protocol (1987) is widely recognized as one of the most effective international environmental agreements. By banning ozone‑depleting substances such as CFCs and halons, it set in motion a measurable recovery of the ozone layer within just a few decades. Using NASA satellite products (merged MOD data and OMI observations), we visualize the long‑term change in global ozone concentration from the late 1970s to the present.

        <strong>About this data:</strong> The graph shows the global mean total column ozone measured in 
        <em>Dobson Units (DU)</em>. One DU represents a 0.01 mm‑thick layer of pure ozone at standard conditions. 
        Higher DU values mean stronger protection from ultraviolet radiation, while lower DU values indicate depletion. 
        The decline in the 1980s–1990s corresponds to widespread CFC use, while the stabilization and recovery after 2000 reflect 
        the atmospheric impact of the <em>Montreal Protocol</em>.

    <p>
      The digital revolution has created a new kind of invisible footprint. Data centers — the physical engines behind AI and cloud computing — account for a rapidly growing share of global electricity demand. Unlike ozone‑depleting chemicals, this infrastructure is still largely unregulated, concentrating energy use, water consumption, and CO₂ emissions in specific regions across the U.S.

  <!-- Section 3: Comparison -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Regulated vs Unregulated</h2>
    <p>
      The Montreal Protocol shows that collective regulation works: over 190 nations agreed to phase out ozone‑depleting chemicals, and the results are visible in the atmosphere today. In contrast, carbon emissions from digital infrastructure continue to rise without consistent global or national policy frameworks. Our visualizations compare how the presence of strong policy versus its absence shapes the trajectory of atmospheric change and environmental recovery.
    </p>
    
  </section>

  <!-- Section 4: Conclusion -->
  <section class="section conclusion">
    <h2>Policy Works — When It Exists</h2>
    <p>
      The ozone layer’s recovery is proof that science‑based policy can shift the atmosphere onto a new path. As we enter a new era of data‑driven and AI‑driven growth, the same urgency and cooperation are needed to govern the emissions of the digital age. If coordinated policy worked once, it can work again — but only if it is extended to the infrastructures that are now driving carbon emissions.
